## collab

Collaboration software for synchronizing files between computers. The
collab daemon runs in the background and editors communicate with the
daemon to synchronize file changes. The goal is to eventually support
all major editors. Think Google Docs but for arbitrary text files, and
using your editor of choice. Very much a work in progress.

This is my first foray into Rust, so please forgive my unidiomatic
code.
